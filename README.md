### Hey, I'm Benjamin Shuster

- I prefer high level, dynamically typed , turing complete, functional programming languages
- Some of my favorite videos are [Java for the Haters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4-HM_sCvtQ), [The Worst programming language ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcFBwt1nu2U), [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat),and definitely [Why javascript sucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE8tL8NdHaY)
- I'm an avid fan of the [Fira code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font as it makes my code look very pretty, and has ligatures
- [my favorite line(s) code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60113342/why-do-class-function-constructors-in-js-evaluate-strings-as-expressions): 
```js
const OBJ={} //define an object
const FN=OBJ['constructor'] //results in a function constructor (acts like eval) 
//https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function
FN(console.log("test")) //call the console.log function in the "fake eval"
```
- I'm also a bit of a security nerd, and bug hunter
